# multiplex-streams
This is the Readme for multiplex streams project.

- If you want to visualise the results on our two datasets, you can find on src/visualisation the Jupyter Notebooks lyc√©e.ipynb, planes-1988.ipynb, planes-1995.ipynb, planes-2010.ipynb, planes-2019.ipynb.

- The library is structured as follows: 
  - intervals.py contains the construction of the intervals.
  - multiLayers.py is a class to represent multilayer graphs.
  - elemMSGraph.py contains the bricks to build the multilayer stream graph.
  - visuMultiStream.py contains the object multilayer stream graph and several methods associated.
  - Drawing.py contains the functions to draw multilayer stream graphs.
